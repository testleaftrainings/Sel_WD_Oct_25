1. Cucumber

Cucumber is a testing framework that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD).
It allows writing test cases in plain English using Gherkin language.
It helps both technical and non-technical people understand test cases easily.
Cucumber tests are written in feature files (.feature).

2. TDD - Test Driven Development

Definition: A development approach where tests are written before writing the actual code.

Steps:

1. Write a failing test.
2. Write the minimum code to make it pass.
3. Refactor the code and repeat.

Goal: To ensure code quality and correctness early in development.

3. ATDD - Acceptance Test Driven Development

Definition: Focuses on writing acceptance tests based on customer requirements before coding.

Example:

* Acceptance test: “User should be able to log in with valid credentials.”
  Developers implement code to make this test pass.

4. BDD - Behavior Driven Development

Definition: BDD extends TDD and ATDD. Tests are written in a natural, readable format using Given–When–Then steps.
It focuses on system behavior rather than technical details.

Example:
Feature: Login functionality
Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
Given user is on login page
When user enters valid username and password
Then user should be navigated to home page

5. Layers of Cucumber

A typical Cucumber framework has the following layers:

1. Feature Layer - Contains feature files written in Gherkin.
2. Step Definition Layer - Contains Java methods linked to Gherkin steps.
3. Runner Layer - Executes test cases and integrates with JUnit/TestNG.
4. Page Object Layer (optional) - Contains locators and reusable page methods.

Flow: Feature File → Step Definition → Application Code

6. Gherkin Keywords

Feature: Describes high-level functionality.
Scenario: Describes a single test case.
Given: Describes preconditions.
When: Describes user actions.
Then: Describes expected outcomes.
And / But: Used to connect multiple steps.
Background: Defines common steps for all scenarios.
Scenario Outline: Used for data-driven testing.
Examples: Provides data for Scenario Outline.

7. Scenario

A Scenario represents a single test case.

Example:
Scenario: Successful login
Given user is on login page
When user enters valid username and password
Then user should see the homepage

8. Static Parameterization

Used when fixed values are passed directly inside the step.

Example:
Scenario: Login with specific username
Given user is on login page
When user enters username "John"
And user enters password "Password123"
Then user should see the dashboard

Step Definition:
@When("user enters username {string}")
public void enterUsername(String username) {
driver.findElement(By.id("username")).sendKeys(username);
}

9. Scenario Outline (Dynamic Parameterization)

Feature: Login functionality of LeafTaps

Scenario Outline: Login with valid credentials
Given launch the browser
Given load the given URL
When enter the username <uName>
And enter the password <pWord>
When Click on the Login button
Then It will navigate to the next page

Examples:
|       uName      |  pWord |
|'Demosalesmanager'|'crmsfa'|
|'Demosalesmanager'| 'crm'  |


Step Definition:
@When("user enters username {string} and password {string}")
public void enterCredentials(String uname, String pwd) {
driver.findElement(By.id("username")).sendKeys(uname);
driver.findElement(By.id("password")).sendKeys(pwd);
}
