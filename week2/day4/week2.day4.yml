DropDown:
A dropdown is a web element that allows the user to select one or more options from a list of predefined values. 
In HTML, its usually represented using the <select> tag. 
In Selenium, we can handle dropdowns using the Select class, which provides methods like 
 - selectByVisibleText,
 - selectByValue, 
 - selectByIndex.

For example, on a registration form, a ‘Country’ field is usually a dropdown 
where we can choose one option from the list of countries.



ClassRoom 1:

dp 1-> index 5
dp 2-> text 'UI for React'
dp 3-> value 'France'
Enter -> First name,Last name, Company Name, Business id, phone no and comments.



Xpath:
XML Path
Xpath-XML Path


Absolute XPath: It starts from the root (html) and traverses down to the desired element, 
detailing every single element in the hierarchy. The path starts with a single forward slash /, 
indicating the root. 
For example: 
/html/body/div[2]/div[2]/div/form/p/input


Relative XPath: It starts from anywhere within the document and typically focuses on 
identifying elements based on attributes, indexes, or specific tags, not necessarily 
detailing the entire path from the root. It starts with a double forward slash //,
 indicating the search can begin anywhere. 
 For example: 



Relative Xpath:

a.Basic xpath
Attribute based xPath: 
Syntax: //tagname[@attributename='attributeValue'] 
Example:  


Text based xPath: 
Syntax: //tagname[text()='textvalue'] 
Example:  


Partial Attribute based xpath: 
Syntax: //tagname[contains(@attributename,'partialattributevalue')] 
Example: 

Partial Text based xpath:
Syntax: //tagname[contains(text(),'partialtextvalue')]
Example: 

Index based xpath:
 Syntax: (//tagname[@attributename='attributeValue'])[2]
(//tagname[text()='textvalue'])[3] 
Example: 
(//input[@class='inputLogin'])[2]
index value should not go beyond 5

(//input[@class='data'])[18]

 Wait:
 Java wait -Thread.sleep(5000); it will wait till time given to be completed

Thread.sleep(3000)

  Selenium wait :
  1.Implicit wait
  2.Explicit wait

  Implicit wait :
  10mins

  at 7mins
  30sec -element action completed it will to next line 
  it will not completed 30sec

  driver.findElement(By.id("username")).senKeys("user");
  thread.sleep(5000);

  but if i am using implicit wait


  its common for both findElement() and findElements()
